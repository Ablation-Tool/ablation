# NetSniffer

**File:** `modules/net_sniffer.py`

## Why this exists

Raw network capture and credential extraction for post-compromise enumeration. Captures clear-text credentials from HTTP Basic, FTP, SMTP AUTH, MQTT CONNECT, and SIP REGISTER frames in a promiscuous-mode socket capture session.

## FORGE audit

Gate: **PASSED**. No HIGH or CRITICAL findings. HTTP XML body reads bounded at `resp.read(65536)`. Socket reads bounded: `sock.recv(4 - len(connack))` (bounded by CONNACK length), `sock.recv(1024)` for banners. Two CWE-770 procfs reads fixed: `/proc/net/arp` and `/proc/net/route` changed from `readlines()` to `read(_MAX_PROC_BYTES).splitlines()`; `_MAX_PROC_BYTES=4MB` constant added. No lief.parse().

## How it works

Establishes a connection to the target using the specified protocol, iterates through a prioritized probe list, and records each response as a structured finding. Probes run in sequence unless `parallel=True` is set. Each probe checks for a specific weakness class: information disclosure, missing authentication, weak configuration, or exposed management interface. Findings are deduped by endpoint and finding type before returning.

---

## Usage

```python
from ablation.analyzers.net_sniffer import NetSniffer

results = NetSniffer.from_context(ctx).run()
for r in results:
    print(r)
```

## Example output

```
[HIGH]     UNAUTH_ACCESS     /api/v1/config/backup
  detail: unauthenticated GET returns full config including credentials
  evidence: HTTP 200, Content-Type: application/json, body: {"admin_pass": ...}

[MEDIUM]   INFO_DISCLOSURE   /status
  detail: version string exposed without authentication
  evidence: X-Version: FortiOS 7.2.1 build 1254
```

---

## False positives

Findings from internal management interfaces, development endpoints, and lab-only services are not real attack surface. Filter by comparing discovered endpoints against the product's documented management plane. Authentication-required findings are lower severity unless a pre-auth bypass is confirmed separately.

---

## Pipeline position

**Before this module:** Network reachability confirmation and credential acquisition. `BinaryContext` is not required; this module works from a live target or captured traffic.

**After this module:** Feed findings to `FindingRegistry.register()` and review with `LLMAnalyst` for chaining opportunities.

## Reading findings

| Field | Content |
|:---|:---|
| `severity` | `CRITICAL` / `HIGH` / `MEDIUM` / `INFO` |
| `finding_type` | Category (e.g., `UNAUTH_ACCESS`, `INFO_DISCLOSURE`, `WEAK_CONFIG`) |
| `endpoint` | URI, port, or service address where the finding was observed |
| `detail` | What was found and why it matters |
| `evidence` | Response excerpt or protocol trace that confirms the finding |
