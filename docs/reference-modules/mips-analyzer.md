# MIPS Analyzer

**File:** `modules/mips_analyzer.py`

## Why this exists

MIPS32/MIPS64 binary analysis: function boundary detection using MIPS prologue patterns (addiu sp/sw ra), delay slot handling, GP-relative addressing ($gp + offset), and MIPS calling convention (a0–a3 argument registers). Used for embedded firmware targets that are MIPS-based (routers, cable modems, DSL equipment).

## Key constants

| Constant | Value | Applied to |
|---|---|---|
| `_MAX_BINARY_BYTES` | 256 MB | Binary file read cap |

## FORGE audit

Gate: **PASSED**. No HIGH or CRITICAL findings. `Path.stat().st_size` guard before `lief.parse()`; `lief.parse()` in `try/except Exception`; `_MAX_BINARY_BYTES=256MB`. No HTTP reads.

## How it works

Reads the binary image and resolves the target-specific data structures (PLT, GOT, `.eh_frame`, symbol tables) to build a function and import index. Architecture-specific calling conventions and instruction encodings are applied to recover call edges, argument registers, and return value locations. Results are stored in the session `BinaryContext` so downstream tools can use resolved names and edges.

---

## Usage

```python
from ablation.analyzers.mips_analyzer import MIPSAnalyzer

results = MIPSAnalyzer.from_context(ctx).run()
for r in results:
    print(r)
```

---

## Example output

```
Resolved 847 PLT entries
Recovered 312 function starts from .eh_frame
Named 28 functions from DWARF remnants

va=0x401200  name=verify_admin_token  confidence=HIGH
va=0x4015C0  name=process_http_request  confidence=HIGH
va=0x403A00  name=''  confidence=MEDIUM  (stripped)
```

---

## False positives

Symbol resolution errors produce phantom function boundaries. Verify any candidate VA against `ctx.func_starts` before analysis. Compiler-synthesized stubs (PLT entries, thunks) appear as functions in some loaders — `BinaryContext` filters known stub patterns but custom thunks may slip through.

---

## Pipeline position

**Before this module:** `BinaryContext.load_or_build()` for symbol and import resolution. For stripped binaries, run `SemanticSearcher` first to identify candidate function VAs.

**After this module:** Pass resolved call edges and function VAs to `TaintTracker` or `SinkArgClassifier`.

---

## Reading findings

| Field | Content |
|:---|:---|
| `va` | Virtual address of the resolved symbol, function, or instruction |
| `name` | Recovered name if available, empty string if stripped |
| `detail` | What was resolved or decoded |
| `confidence` | `HIGH` / `MEDIUM` / `LOW` — how certain the resolution is |
